T1 R1 hardcore harvester
- adds value to blast furnace to be able to quickly use lots of ores

T1 R2 production master
- great for cannon-balls
- devalues blast furnace if you choose that region

T1 R3 +10 non-combat skills
- cant use boots on minnows
- cant boost for a trident because you can only kill kraken on task and can't get a task with boosting
- cant boost for sepulcre or pyramid plunder
- some quest requirements are not boostable
- gives people more time to PVM because most skilling will stop at 89
