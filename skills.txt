easy:

- fishing: fly fishing until karambons
    - evil bob event its lots of fishing xp early (maybe don't fish until getting that)
    - no bait/fly fishing available in misthalin, 2nd area might want to choose place with fishing shop and feathers
- runecrafting: no competition

med:

- farming: herb/tree runs
  - very hard to level in misthalin, lvl 10 redberries or lvl 15 oaks then lvl 23 seaweed
- smithing: easy to bank mining things, need lvl 15 to smith iron (superheat does not smith the whole inventory)
- cooking: easy if you can bank the fish
- woodcutting: will be crowded at first, easy to find a spot without banking but hard to find a spot with banking
- fletching: easy if you bank the wood
