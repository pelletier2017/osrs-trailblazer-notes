Things that are important when considering region
- BIS weapons (elf+desert for darts to use BP, kandarin for trident, mory for rapier, misthalin for whip)
- rune shop
    - expensive ones (prif, ali baba in frem)
    - cheaper (mage guild in kandarin, wilderness shop, ali baba runes)
- theiving (ardy for knights, desert for blackjack)
- smithing (blast furnace in frem if you don't take R2)
- runecrafting (ZMI in kandarin, desert + frem for lunars to do lava runes)
- ranging (kandarin for chins + MM2 tunnels, wildy for chins)
- crafting (lunars for glassmaking, alternatively gem mines in shilo village)

area combo's
- elf + desert for blowpipe + ability to make smith darts (even easier with R2)
- kandarin + desert for bursting MM2 tunnels
- kandarin + frem + wildy for ZMI with lunars and NPC contact for repairing pouches
- kandarin + asgarnia for cannon (quest starts in kandarin)
- kandarin + mory for enhanced slayer helm + imbued salve amulet
- kandarin + elf for trident of the swamp
- asgarnia + mory for guardian boots + avernic defender


questions that might change my area choice:
- trident is in kandarin RIGHT?
- is monkey madness in kandarin?

my preferred areas (order kandarin, desert, elf in that order) (R2 works well with these areas)
- Misthalin
- Kandarin
  - NMZ, trident, zenytes, barb fishing
- desert
  - able to smith darts for my blowpipe, agility pyramid for early gp
  - ancients for burst tasks (spend gp for blood runes) could also burst in MM2 tunnels
- Elf
  - zulrah, zolcano, gauntlet

undecided:
- morytanya
  - black mask (improved at nmz) (could go void instead)
  - ahrims for zulrah (alternative is buy mystic in wizard guild)
- asgarnia
    - cannon
    - possibly void
    - mining guild
    - defender

fine with skipping:

  - not missing much
- karamja
  - might lose zenytes
- possibly fremmenick
